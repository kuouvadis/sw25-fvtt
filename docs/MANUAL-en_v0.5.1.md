## Effects

### Effects Classification (Buffs and Debuffs)
- As a general rule, we assume that Effects are set on items, which are then applied to characters when they possess them.
- It is also possible to create effects  on the character sheet and apply them directly to the character.

#### Temporary Effects
- Effects that are active and have a duration of application.
- Useful for magic, Personal Items, and Combat Feats that have a duration.
- It can be toggled on and off.
- You can change the classification to always active by leaving the duration blank.

#### Passive Effects
- Effects that are active and have no duration.
- It is useful for accessories, racial traits, and the effects of any Personal Items.
- It can be toggled on and off.
- You can change the classification to temporary by entering a duration.

#### Inactive Effects
- These are temporary Effects and passive Effects that have been disabled.
- New Effects created under this list are created as disabled temporary Effects.

### Effects Settings

#### Details Tab
- You can set the color of the icon and the description of the Effect.
- Checking "Effect Suspended" has the same function as enabling/disabling it in the list.
- Effects from items will have a check box to indicate whether or not they should be applied to the character who possesses them or not.

#### Duration Tab
You can set the duration in the Effect Duration (Turns) field.
- It is recommended to use the setting in turns, as setting it in seconds does not affect the functionality.
- The starting turn is automatically entered during combat, but can also be changed manually.
- The “Times Up” mod can be used to automatically decrease the duration of the turn setting.
  - Since the rule “the effect lasts until the beginning of the character's own turn” is unique to Sword World cannot be applied, there will be a slight discrepancy if this mod is used.

#### Effects Tab
- Multiple effects can be created for a single buff/debuff by clicking the + Button.
- At this time, the attribute keys to which effects are automatically applied to are limited to those listed in the pull-down menu.
- Negative values can also be entered for effect values.

### How to Apply Effects

#### Applied to Other Characters
- Target the character you wish to apply the Effect to. Multiple targets can be selected and applied to at the same time.
- After selecting the target, click on the Effects button in the list of your character sheet or the Effect button in the chat box to apply the Effects to the target.
- The applied Effects can be viewed in the Effects tab of the character. They can be enabled or disabled on a character-by-character basis.
- If more than one Effect is applied to an item, they will all be applied. Unnecessary Effects should be manually removed after application.
- Temporary Effects that are disabled will be activated upon application.

### Notes on Effects
- Currently, Effects can only be applied to PCs, e.g., PC to PC or demon to PC.
- In the case of PC -> monster, monster -> monster, etc., the Effect will not be applied to the monster, but will be displayed in the Effects tab. This can be used to manage the duration of the Effect.
- Most of the attribute keys that can be used for Effects have an entry field on the character sheet, and the field changes when the Effect is applied.
- Please note that we do not manage duplicates of the same Effects, so beware of unintended duplicates.
- ** Attention! ** When an Effect is applied, the corresponding input field cannot be changed by direct input. If you want to change it, deactivate the Effect, make the change, and then reactivate the Effect.
- **Note! ** The Effects of Personal Items and Critical Ray only apply to the selected weapon.

## Macro Support

### YutoSheetII Import Macro

## Precautions
- The functions that can be used for FVTT-like sessions have been implemented.
- This is a beta version. There is a high possibility that some bugs may remain.
- Error handling is lax.
- A warning message appears on the console, but since there is no problem with the operation, it has been left alone for the time being.
- We have not tested the compatibility with the mod. It is compatible with "Dice So Nice!" and "Times Up"
- The layout has not been validated in English.
- Limited permissions for NPCs and monsters, icons and images will not be changed.
- We recommend using the “Times Up” mod to manage the duration of buffs and debuffs.
- Combat has not been implemented. We recommend that you take initiative manually or install mods.
- An example of a mod that supports the order of action (I personally think that Popcorn Initiative is suited for this)
  - Popcorn type "Lancer Initiative" and "Just Popcorn Initiative
  - Group type "Group Initiative" and "Combat Tracker Extensions"
